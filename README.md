## Summary
I'll set the scene. You get home after a long day of work, make your dinner, and sit down with your dog to watch your favorite TV show. Half way through, a dog begins barking on the TV. You struggle to mute the tv as not to alert your dog. Alas, the dog has been disturbed and is now
barking at the top of its lungs and it takes forever to calm it down. Your nice, quiet evening is interrupted. 

Enter HollyWoof. This is an application that will allow users to register, login, report and view movies or shows that contain dog barks, and even set a timestamp and a volume level for the occurrence. That way you can be prepared the next time a dog is about to bark on tv.
